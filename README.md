# Research slides

This repository hosts slides generated from different sub-projects.
This way, I only need to set up the software environment once (pandoc,
reveal.js,...). Any pictures should be locally accessible, too, such
that slides can also be shown without internet access from a local
server. Therefore, individual projects are included as git submodules. 

There should exist a comprehensive Makefile to update all slides.
